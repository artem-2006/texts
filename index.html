        <p class="text1">I`d like to present the topic "hobbies and interests". Hobby is something people  enjoy doing in their free time and do it with great pleasure. There are a lot of diffrent
            kings of hobbies and spare time activities. Creative hobbies such as sewing, paiting, dancing, sport and games: playing football, hockey, ice-skating, computer and technology activities. Now I want to tell you about my hobby. It is riding an exstreme scooter.
            I started skating when I was eleven years old. I have chosen this hobby becouse it is very interesting. In future I did like to try showbording as I thing it is exciting. In conclusion I can say that our life would be boring without hobbies. A hobby can help to bring people together and exspress your personality.

        <h1>Text-2 <br> Topic "Traweling"</h1>
        <p class="text2">I`d like to present the topic "Travelling broadens one`s outlook". Travelling is an important, amusing and interesting part of our lives. There are a lot of types of travelling: beach holiday, "package" holiday, camping, cruise, etc. I prefer beach holiday becouse I like go swimming. I know a lot of holiday activities such as buying souvenirs, sightseeing, horse riding and others. During my holiday I like to to buy souvenirs because it is a memory of this place. I have visited different place but my favorite city is Antalya. There are interesting places there, for example, the Old Town of Kaleichi. There you can see the most important sights. If you want to visit this country I`d recommend to visit Alanya Fortress. The weather is good there. In conclusion, I can say that travilling helps us to learn new information, meet other people, broaden our mind.

<h1>Text-3 <br> Topic"Job"</h1>
        <p class="text-3">I`d like to present the topic "Job". Job is an important part of live. It is essential to work to live, eat and travel. There are different professions: teacher, doctor, computer programmer, civil servant, worker and others.
            I think it is important to choose the rihgt career becouse if you like your job, you can realize potential, satisfy the soul and do your work with pleasure. It is also important to be suitable for the post. My future career is programmer. I think this profession suits me perfectly becouse I like to write programs. Nowadays a lot of students have part-time jobs, they work as a waiter, delivery person, shop assistant. I don`t work becouse I study at college and have no time fot work.

             <h1>Text-4 <br>Topic"Crimes" </h1> 
    <p class="text-4"> I would like to present the topic "Crimes". Unfortunately, some people commit crimes, they are called criminals.
        There are different crimes: arson, burglary, robbery, shoplifting and ofher. I think that the most serious crimes are murder and kidnapping. I`m sure that nobody has the right to take the life or freedom of another person. There are the worst things a person can do. Some crimes are not extremely serious, such as shoplifting. Shoplifting usually have to pay a fine for their illegal action. Fortunately, police always investigate all the ctimes, catch the criminals and put them into prison. To my mind, all the criminals are not good people, they must be punished for even small crime. </p>
