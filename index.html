        <h1> Text-1 <br>"Hobbies and interests"</h1>
        <p class="text1">I`d like to present the topic "hobbies and interests". Hobby is something people  enjoy doing in their free time and do it with great pleasure. There are a lot of diffrent
            kings of hobbies and spare time activities. Creative hobbies such as sewing, paiting, dancing, sport and games: playing football, hockey, ice-skating, computer and technology activities. Now I want to tell you about my hobby. It is riding an exstreme scooter.
            I started sking when I was eleven years old. I have chosen this hobby becouse it is very interesting. In future I did like to try showbording as I thing it is exciting. In conclusion I can say that our life would be boring without hobbies. A hobby can help to bring people together and exspress your personality.

        <h1>Text-2 <br> Topic "Traweling"</h1>
        <p class="text2">I`d like to present the topic "Travelling broadens one`s outlook". Travelling is an important, amusing and interesting part of our lives. There are a lot of types of travelling: beach holiday, "package" holiday, camping, cruise, etc. I prefer beach holiday becouse I like go swimming. I know a lot of holiday activities such as buying souvenirs, sightseeing, horse riding and others. During my holiday I like to to buy souvenirs because it is a memory of this place. I have visited different place but my favorite city is Antalya. There are interesting places there, for example, the Old Town of Kaleichi. There you can see the most important sights. If you want to visit this country I`d recommend to visit Alanya Fortress. The weather is good there. In conclusion, I can say that travilling helps us to learn new information, meet other people, broaden our mind.
